# Garage-Door
a repo for improvements to the garage door opener interface

Desired functionality:
- Any improvements must work with existing garage door interfaces
- Control and monitor garage door status from simple interfaces


Want to be able to interact with the system:
- Using the existing button by the door between house and garage (no work needed, just leave the button there)
- Using a keypad button (does not yet exist) on the door frame
- Using the garage door openers in the cars (only in two cars)
- Using an app
- Automatically (if desired)
